High Modularity: Breaking the program into the smallest logical, independent units. This makes components easier to understand, develop, and test in isolation.
Simplicity and Readability (at the function level): Individual functions are kept short and focused, making their specific logic easy to grasp.
Reusability of Components: Small, well-defined functions (especially iterators and utility functions) can be reused in different parts of the application or in other projects.
Mimicking Higher-Level Abstractions: The iterator pattern with static variables and reset mechanisms is a C-idiomatic way to achieve what iterators or generators do in higher-level languages. The "pipe" functions attempt a basic form of functional composition.
Reduced Complexity: By decomposing the problem into manageable pieces.
Improve Maintainability: Changes within one module are less likely to break others.
Easier Debugging: Smaller units are easier to isolate and test.
Clarity of Data Flow: While state is managed, the access points are usually well-defined.
Generalized Thought Pattern for This Style:

"Decompose every part of the problem into its most fundamental operations, each represented by a small, focused function. Strive for clarity by making functions perform one task and by using return codes to signal status or data effectively."
General Principles:

Modularity: Break down code into small, single-purpose functions.
Clarity over Premature Optimization: Write code that is easy to understand first.

This programming style emphasizes building software through small, composable functions that work together to create complex behaviors. The fundamental principle is to break down problems into their smallest logical components and then combine these components in various ways to achieve desired outcomes.

Single Responsibility Functions
Every function should have one clear, well-defined purpose. Functions should be named in a way that immediately communicates their intent and should do exactly what their name suggests - nothing more, nothing less.
Functional Composition
Complex operations emerge from combining simple functions rather than writing monolithic code blocks. This approach creates a toolkit of reusable components that can be mixed and matched to solve different problems.
Abstraction Layering
Code should be organized in distinct layers, where higher-level functions use lower-level utilities without needing to understand their implementation details. Each layer should provide a clean interface that hides complexity from the layers above it.
Generic Utility Separation
Reusable, domain-agnostic functions should be clearly separated from business-specific logic. This creates a foundation of reliable tools that can be used across different parts of the application.
Enhanced Testability
Small, focused functions are easier to test because they have clear inputs and outputs with minimal side effects. Each function can be tested in isolation, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.
Better Maintainability
Changes to internal function implementations don't affect their callers as long as the interface remains the same. This isolation makes refactoring safer and easier.
Bottom-Up Construction
Start by identifying the most basic operations your program needs, then build increasingly complex functions by combining these primitives. This creates a solid foundation of well-tested components.
Iterative Refinement
Continuously evaluate whether functions are doing too much. If a function becomes difficult to name clearly or grows beyond a screen, consider breaking it down further.
Dependency Minimization
Functions should depend on as few external elements as possible. This makes them more portable, testable, and easier to reason about.
Clear Data Flow
Structure your program so data flows clearly from simple transformations through more complex operations. Each step should be obvious and the overall data transformation should be easy to follow.
This style creates codebases that are resilient to change because modifications typically affect only small, isolated functions. New features can often be implemented by combining existing utilities in new ways rather than writing everything from scratch. Debugging becomes more straightforward because problems can be isolated to specific functions, and code review becomes more effective because reviewers can focus on small, understandable units of functionality.

The ultimate goal is to create software that is self-documenting through its structure, where the organization and naming of functions tells the story of what the program does and how it works.
