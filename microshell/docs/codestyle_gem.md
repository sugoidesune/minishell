Our coding philosophy centers on decomposing complex problems into the smallest logical, independent, and single-responsibility units (functions). The goal is to build software from these highly modular, simple, and readable components, fostering reusability and mimicking higher-level abstractions like iterators and functional composition.

Key principles include:

High Modularity & Single Responsibility: Break programs into the smallest possible, focused functions, each performing one well-defined task.
Simplicity and Readability: Prioritize clear, concise functions that are easy to understand.
Reusability: Design small, well-defined functions (especially utilities) for use across different parts of the application or other projects.
Abstraction Layering: Organize code in layers, where higher-level functions use lower-level utilities without needing to know their internal details.
Functional Composition: Achieve complex operations by combining simple functions rather than writing monolithic code blocks.
Enhanced Testability & Maintainability: Small, isolated functions are easier to test, debug, and modify without impacting other parts of the system. Changes within one module are less likely to break others.
Clear Data Flow: Structure programs for obvious data transformation paths.
Bottom-Up Construction: Start by implementing fundamental operations, then build more complex functions by combining these primitives.
Iterative Refinement: Continuously assess if functions are doing too much and break them down further if necessary.
Dependency Minimization: Functions should rely on as few external elements as possible to enhance portability and reduce complexity.
This approach aims to create self-documenting, resilient, and maintainable software where new features can often be implemented by combining existing utilities.
