Great questions! Let me explain how wait() and the status variable work:

How wait() works:
wait() blocks until ANY child process terminates
It returns the PID of the child that terminated
It fills the status variable with information about how the child exited
The connection between status and children:
The status variable is passed by reference to wait():

When a child process exits, the kernel stores exit information in the status variable. This includes:

Exit code (0 for success, non-zero for error)
Whether it was killed by a signal
Which signal killed it (if any)
Why we can use uninitialized status:
The wait() function overwrites whatever garbage value was in status, so initialization isn't needed.

How wait_for_all_children() works:
Each call to wait(&status) waits for one child to finish. We call it command_count times to wait for all children.

The status variable gets reused each time - we don't need to store the individual exit codes in this simple implementation.

// How wait_for_all_children() works step by step:

void wait_for_all_children(int command_count)
{
    int status;  // Uninitialized - this is OK!
    int i;
    
    i = 0;
    while (i < command_count)  // Loop for each child process
    {
        // wait() does 3 things:
        // 1. BLOCKS until ANY child process exits
        // 2. WRITES exit info into status variable (overwrites garbage)
        // 3. RETURNS the PID of the child that just exited
        wait(&status);  // &status = "address of status variable"
        
        i++;  // Count: "we've waited for 1 more child"
    }
    // After loop: ALL children have been waited for
}
```c
// Example execution with 3 commands:
// 
// Parent forks 3 children: PID 100, 101, 102
// 
// Call 1: wait(&status) - blocks until child 102 exits, status gets filled
// Call 2: wait(&status) - blocks until child 100 exits, status gets overwritten  
// Call 3: wait(&status) - blocks until child 101 exits, status gets overwritten
//
// Now all 3 children are "reaped" - no zombies left

// Why uninitialized status works:
int status;           // Contains garbage: 0x1A2B3C4D
wait(&status);        // Kernel OVERWRITES with real exit info: 0x00000000
// We never READ the old garbage value, only let wait() WRITE to it

// The connection between status and children:
// - Each child process has an exit code when it terminates
// - Kernel stores this in a table, indexed by child PID  
// - wait() copies this info FROM kernel table TO our status variable
// - &status tells wait() WHERE to write the exit information

// In your temp_ignore.c code, this section does the same thing:
// Wait for all children
i = 0;
while (i < command_count)
{
    wait(&status);  // Wait for one child, fill status with its exit info
    i++;           // Move to next iteration
}
// After this loop: all children processes have been waited for
