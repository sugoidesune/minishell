Modular Composition Programming Philosophy
This philosophy centers on building software through small, composable functions that combine to create complex behaviors. The core principle is decomposing problems into their smallest logical components and combining these components to achieve desired outcomes.

Core Principles
Single Responsibility: Every function has one clear purpose, named to communicate intent
Functional Composition: Complex operations emerge from combining simple functions
Bottom-Up Construction: Build complex functions by combining well-tested primitives
Iterative Refinement: If a function is hard to name clearly, break it down further
Structure & Organization
Abstraction Layering: Higher-level functions use lower-level utilities through clean interfaces
Generic Utility Separation: Domain-agnostic functions separated from business logic
Clear Data Flow: Obvious transformation steps from simple to complex operations
Dependency Minimization: Functions depend on minimal external elements
Benefits
Enhanced Testability: Small functions with clear inputs/outputs, minimal side effects
Better Maintainability: Interface consistency allows safe internal changes
Resilient Codebase: Modifications affect only isolated functions
Self-Documenting: Function organization and naming tells the program's story
Guiding Principle: Clarity over premature optimization. Create a toolkit of reusable components that can be mixed and matched, where new features emerge from combining existing utilities rather than writing from scratch.
