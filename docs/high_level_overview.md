Here’s a high-level overview of the puzzle pieces that make up Minishell. Each step outlines a major component of the process, its goal, and how it fits into the overall flow. I’ll introduce functions in the early steps to establish a foundation, then build on those concepts without repeating the function names unnecessarily. Let’s dive in!

---

### 1. Capture and Prepare User Input
**Goal**: Take the raw input from the user and transform it into a clean, usable command string for further processing.  
- We use `readline` to display a prompt (e.g., "minishell> ") and retrieve the user’s typed command as a string.  
- We check if the input is valid (not NULL, which happens with Ctrl+D) and use `add_history` to store it in the command history for later recall.  
- We trim or sanitize the string to remove unnecessary whitespace or handle edge cases (e.g., empty input).  
  - This ensures the input is ready for parsing in the next step.  
- The final result is a cleaned-up command string (let’s call it the **raw command**).

### 2. Parse the Raw Command into Tokens
**Goal**: Break the raw command into manageable pieces (tokens) that represent commands, arguments, and operators so we can understand its structure.  
- We split the raw command on spaces and special characters (e.g., `|`, `<`, `>`), respecting quotes (`'` and `"`) to avoid splitting inside quoted sequences.  
- We handle expansions:  
  - Replace `$VAR` with environment variable values using `getenv`.  
  - Replace `$?` with the exit status of the last command (tracked globally).  
- We categorize tokens into commands, arguments, and operators (e.g., pipes, redirections).  
  - This allows us to build a structured representation (let’s call it the **token list**).  
- The final token list is a sequence of meaningful units ready for execution planning.  

---

### 3. Build an Execution Plan
**Goal**: Organize the token list into a plan (let’s call it the **command structure**) that defines how commands, pipes, and redirections will be executed.  
- We group tokens into individual commands (e.g., `ls -l | grep txt` becomes two commands: `ls -l` and `grep txt`).  
- We identify redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<`) and their targets (files or delimiters).  
- We detect pipes (`|`) and link commands accordingly.  
- For each command, we determine if it’s a built-in (e.g., `cd`, `echo`) or an external program needing PATH resolution with `access`.  
- The final command structure is a tree or list of commands with their arguments, redirections, and pipe relationships.  

---

### 4. Set Up Signal Handling
**Goal**: Ensure the shell responds correctly to interrupts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl-\) without crashing or losing control.  
- We use `sigaction` to define handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGQUIT (Ctrl-\), and rely on `readline`’s EOF detection for Ctrl+D.  
- For Ctrl+C, we set a global variable to the signal number, clear the current input with `rl_replace_line`, move to a new line with `rl_on_new_line`, and redraw the prompt with `rl_redisplay`.  
- For Ctrl-\, we ignore it (do nothing).  
- For Ctrl+D, we exit the shell cleanly with `exit` if no input is provided.  
- This ensures smooth interactive behavior and keeps the command structure safe from signal interference.

### 5. Execute the Command Structure
**Goal**: Run the commands in the command structure, handling built-ins, external programs, pipes, and redirections correctly.  
- **For Built-ins**:  
  - We check the command name and call the appropriate function:  
    - `echo`: Write output with `write`, respecting the `-n` option.  
    - `cd`: Change directory with `chdir`.  
    - `pwd`: Get and print the current directory with `getcwd`.  
    - `export`: Update environment variables.  
    - `unset`: Remove environment variables.  
    - `env`: Print environment variables.  
    - `exit`: Terminate the shell.  
- **For External Commands**:  
  - We use `fork` to create a child process.  
  - In the child, we set up redirections using `open` for files and `dup2` to redirect stdin/stdout.  
  - If pipes are involved, we use `pipe` to connect commands, redirecting output to the pipe’s write end and input from the pipe’s read end with `dup2`.  
  - We execute the program with `execve`, passing the token list’s arguments and environment.  
  - In the parent, we use `waitpid` to wait for the child and retrieve its exit status for `$?`.  
- **For Pipelines**:  
  - We repeat the fork-and-redirect process for each command, chaining them via pipes.  
- The execution updates the shell’s state (e.g., exit status, directory) and produces output.  

---

### 6. Manage Redirections and Pipes
**Goal**: Ensure input/output flows correctly between commands, files, and the terminal as specified in the command structure.  
- For `<`, we open the input file and redirect stdin with `dup2`.  
- For `>`, we open the output file (truncate mode) and redirect stdout.  
- For `>>`, we open the output file (append mode) and redirect stdout.  
- For `<<`, we read input until a delimiter (using `readline` in a loop) and redirect it to stdin via a temporary pipe or file.  
- For `|`, we connect the output of one command to the input of the next using the pipe ends.  
- We close unused file descriptors with `close` to avoid leaks.  
- This ensures the command structure’s I/O requirements are fully implemented.  

---

### 7. Loop Back to the Prompt
**Goal**: Return to the start, displaying a fresh prompt and maintaining shell state for the next command.  
- We update the exit status (`$?`) based on the last command’s result.  
- We reset any temporary states (e.g., close remaining file descriptors).  
- We display the prompt again using the raw command capture process from step 1.  
- The shell remains interactive until terminated (e.g., by `exit` or Ctrl+D).  

---

### How the Pieces Connect
- **Step 1 (Capture)** produces the raw command, feeding into **Step 2 (Parse)**.  
- **Step 2** turns the raw command into a token list, which **Step 3 (Plan)** organizes into a command structure.  
- **Step 4 (Signals)** runs in the background, protecting the process at all times.  
- **Step 5 (Execute)** uses the command structure, relying on **Step 6 (Redirections/Pipes)** for I/O setup.  
- **Step 7 (Loop)** resets the shell, looping back to **Step 1** for continuous operation.

### Big Picture
Minishell is like an assembly line:  
- It starts with user input (raw material).  
- Parses and plans it into a blueprint (command structure).  
- Executes it with precise I/O control (pipes, redirections).  
- Cleans up and repeats, all while staying responsive to signals.  

Each piece builds on the last, transforming a string into actions, with the allowed functions providing the tools to make it happen. Does this give you a clear roadmap? Let me know if you’d like to zoom in on any part!
